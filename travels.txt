Fav places to travel to and why.

The best vacation of my life was January 2020.  My lovely girlfriend and I went to Thailand.
It was absolutely wonderful and I could pontificate here for paragraphs, just amazing everything.

I also love to go back home to Miami to visit but would not live there until it is time to be old and die. #florida

Belize was also spectacular.  Fresh, cheap lobster at every turn.  Truly a great time.

Within the US I was shocked how much I loved San Diego.  Really cool vibes and great weather.
